# Spader

S(ingle)P(age)A(pplication)der is a crawler that scans the bundled JS files in your single page application for endpoints. This tool will be useful if you are trying to enumerate all the endpoints/APIs your application have.

## Compatibility
Currently, this tool only works with **webpack**.
